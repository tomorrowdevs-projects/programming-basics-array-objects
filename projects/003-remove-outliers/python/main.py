#When analysing data collected as part of a science experiment it may be desirable to remove the most extreme values before performing other calculations.
#Write a function that takes a list of values and an non-negative integer, n, as its parameters.
#The function should create a new copy of the list with the n largest elements and the n smallest elements removed.
#Then it should return the new copy of the list as the functionâ€™s only result.
#The order of the elements in the returned list does not have to match the order of the elements in the original list.
#Write a main program that demonstrates your function. It should read a list of numbers from the user and remove the two largest and two smallest values from it by calling the function described previously.
#Display the list with the outliers removed, followed by the original list.
#Your program should generate an appropriate error message if the user enters less than 4 values.
